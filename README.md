<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Austin</h1>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>
	I am a 20 year old software engineer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I have interned at Google, CIBC, and Tumblewire inc. I am currently
	in entering my third year of the Computer Science program at McMaster University. I have
	been programming since about the age of 12, but only really started to get
	into it when I learned C# and Unity in late 2019. I have competed in many types of 
	development competitions and hackathons such as Deltahacks X and the GDSC. 
	I have received distinction in the 2020, 2021, and 2022
	Canadian Computing Competitions ran by the University of Waterloo. I also enjoy building projects for myself and others and have gained most of my programming experience this way. You can visit my website
	hosted <a href="https://austinbray.com/">here</a> on AWS.
